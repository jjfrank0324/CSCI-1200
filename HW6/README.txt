COLLABORATORS AND OTHER RESOURCES:
List the names of everyone you talked to about this assignment
(classmates, TAs, ALAC tutors, upperclassmen, students/instructor via
LMS, etc.), and all of the resources (books, online reference
material, etc.) you consulted in completing this assignment.

< None >

Remember: Your implementation for this assignment must be done on your
own, as described in "Academic Integrity for Homework" handout.



ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  < insert 114 hours >



ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE OF YOUR ALGORITHM:
(order notation & concise paragraph, < 200 words)
The dimensions of the board (w and h) 
The number of ships (s)? 
The total number of occupied cells (o) or open water (w)? 
The number of constraints (c)? 
The number of unknown sums (u) or unspecified ship types (t)? 
Etc. 

For normal cases, the order notation would be O( s^(w*h)) since I need to go though the whole list
For the unknown cases, the order notation would be O( s^(7*w*h))


SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE OF YOUR PROGRAM ON THE PROVIDED PUZZLES:
# of solutions & approximate wall clock running time for different
puzzles for a single solution or all solutions.
