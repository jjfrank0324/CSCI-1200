DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SHIPFREIGHT ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 

Each train I created will have only one engine.
I will keep adding it till it reach the max speecd
if it reach the max speed, I will store the train into the vector of train
finally, it combine two possible train from the whole vector, and return the train
This solution is the best because it can combining whole possible combination for the train
This function can make sure the speed of each train is just around the min speed requirement, which is optimal



DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SEPARATE ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimally comfortable trains (smaller values for average
distance to dining and/or larger values for closest engine to sleeper)
and/or handling cases with > 2 engines.  Student choice on how to
prioritze between these goals.  Describe your priorization and your
implementation.

Since engines are the most hesviest things,  I will take engines as the priority for this functions.
 We use the datas that we gather  to make sure that the enginees on each side is balancees.
if  not, we wil see the conditions , and use my own helper function switch_train to do the switching things

This solution is optimal because the engines on each side is balaneces( Since engine is the most heavy thing and it can boost speed of  the trains)


MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
This homework is literlly killing me. You not only must be familiar with the double linked list but also know how to set up the best mathematic model.
